One thing you really need to focus on is the equpiment for soccer, as shown in the image. You really need to make sure you have equipment going into your first day back. Equipment includes a jersey, socks, cleats, shinguards, shorts, and maybe a ball. Make sure you never forget these going into a game or you might not be able to play at all.

<p>You can not forget the equipment you need in order to play this sport. The equipment is SO important, I can not express it enough. One time, I forgot a piece of my equipment and if no one else has extras, that means you can not play and it might boost you down if you were a starter. If you plan on being a goalkeeper you should always have your own set of gloves and an extra pair. Some refs are also very picky on your equipment so you really need to make sure you buy the proper equipment and follow the guidlines. </p>
