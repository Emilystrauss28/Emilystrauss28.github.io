		Traveling is very big with soccer especially if you join a club team! Traveling is so much fun within soccer and it just is something you always look forward too. Even school teams involves traveling and sometimes you get out of classes for it. It also makes you better playingh across the state with other teams. 
	


 

<h1 style="font-family:arial;">Time to travel!</h1>

<ul>
	<p>Traveling is a time commitment deal.Traveling is a more competitive level of soccer, it means you are ready to go face your components. While traveling, you have to make sure you have the equipment you need, otherwise you can not play. The coaches might also get angry at you especially if you are a starter, because that shows you are not ready to be a starter and you were unprepared which can give you a bad look. Traveling is so much fun because you connect with your teammates and make memories you didn't know you can make. Since, I am from Wisconsin, we normally only ever traveled aroudn the state to the nearest city. The farthest for high school soccer that I would travel to was always atleast an hour away. </p>
