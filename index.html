		<p>Hello! My name is Emily Strauss and this is my homepage. This will introduce me talking about sports as I am huge in sports especially soccer. I am currently a junior at UW-Madison studying agribusiness with a certificate in digital studies. This website is going to contain my life and soccer. Soccer has been a huge part in my life and I have played it ever since I was a little kid. If you have played soccer as well or loved it as much as I do, then this website is good for you. I would never have been here if it wasn't for my experience in playing soccer.</p>
