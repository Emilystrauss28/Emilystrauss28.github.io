		Something a little about me is that I love the sport, soccer. I used to play when I was little and I went to college to play. I did transfer colleges very recently but now I am playing intramural soccer and I think it is a lot of fun! Soccer is a sport that can get your body moving and get you in the right mindset. The sport makes many people have nothing but a happy mindset while playing and outside of the sport. You connect with teammates also and makes you build friendships. It also helps you stay very active while your off season, you migth not be unless you play club soccer just like I did.

<ul>
	<p>Soccer is a team sport with only 11 players against another team of 11 players on a field. A soccer game is typically 90 minutes long so be prepared for that. It can get a little aggressive but you have to be willing to put in the work and be just as aggressive as other players. Every player has a different position, so your coach will be the decision of what position you are strong in. There is always one goalkeeper so if you think you can be that person, do not be afraid and tell your coach you would lob=ve to be a goalkeeper. They do although play one of the most import positions in the whole sport.</p>
